Description: An extension to the individual claim simulator called "SynthETIC",
    to simulate the evolution of case estimates of incurred losses through the
    lifetime of a claim. The transactional simulation output now comprises key
    dates, and both claim payments and revisions of estimated incurred losses.
    An initial set of test parameters, designed to mirror the experience of a 
    real insurance portfolio, were set up and applied by default to generate a 
    realistic test data set of incurred histories (see vignette). However, the 
    distributional assumptions used to generate this data set can be easily 
    modified by users to match their experiences.
